After becoming involved in the anti-apartheid movement in his 20s,
        Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1942. For 20 years, he directed a campaign of peaceful, nonviolent defiance against the South African government and its racist policies.

<!--- Nelson Mandela early life information-->
      <header>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
      </header>

      <p> 
        Mandela was born on <i> July 18, 1918 </i>, in the tiny village of Mvezo, on the banks of the Mbashe River in Transkei, South Africa. 
        <br>
        <br>
        His birth name was<i> Rolihlahla Mandela <i>. "Rolihlahla" in the Xhosa language literally means <i> "pulling the branch of a tree,"</i> but more commonly translates as <i>"troublemaker."</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Mandela's father, who was destined to be a chief, served as a counselor to tribal chiefs for several years, but lost both his title and fortune over a dispute with the local colonial magistrate. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Mandela was only an infant at the time, and his father's loss of status forced his mother to move the family to Qunu, an even smaller village
        north of Mvezo. The village was nestled in a narrow grassy valley; there were no roads, only footpaths that linked the pastures where livestock grazed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The family lived in huts and ate a local harvest of maize, sorghum, pumpkin and beans, which was all they could afford. Water came from springs and streams and cooking was done outdoors. 
        <br>
        <br>
         Mandela played the games of young boys, acting out male right-of-passage scenarios with toys he made from the natural materials available, including tree branches and clay.

            <strong>HE BECAME THE NATIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE ANC YOUTH LEAGUE IN 1950</strong> 
           <i> African National Congress</i> (ANC) was ormed in 1912 to bring all africans together as one People
           to defend their rights and freedoms in South Africa. Nelson Mandela became increasing politically acitve
           in his 20s and in 1994, he joined the ANC. In pril of the same year, Mandela and other young ANC intellectuals 
           founded the <i> African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL), the Youth wing of ANC.</i>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <strong>MANDELA WAS A LEADING OPPONENT OF THE 1948 APARTHEID LEGISLATION</strong>
            <i> Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination </i> in South Africa. Although legislation that discriminated against black Africans had existed for many years, when the openly racialist National Party came to power in 1948, it introduced scores of new discriminatory laws.
            These included laws which segregated public premises; limited places where blacks were permitted to work; limited land ownership by black people; forbade marriage between white people and people of other races; and so on. In 1952, ANC launched the Defiance Campaign against apartheid,<i> the first “large-scale, multi-racial 
            political mobilization against apartheid laws under a common leadership.”</i>
          </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>HE CO-FOUNDED THE FIRST BLACK LEGAL PARTNERSHIP IN SOUTH AFRICA</strong> 
          In <i> 1952, </i> <i> Nelson Mandela was elected President of the ANC’s branch in Transvaal. </i> 
          In August 1953, Mandela, along with <i> Oliver Tambo </i>, opened a law firm in Johannesburg named Mandela and Tambo. Tambo, who would later serve as President of ANC from 1967 to 1991, was a close friend of Mandela. Mandela and Tambo was  <i> the first black legal partnership in South Africa  </i> 
          and, at the time,<i> the only all black African law firm in the country. </i> It was hugely popular with blacks and dealt with many cases, often those of police brutality. It closed in 1960 as anti-apartheid struggle consumed most of the time of its two founders. 
      </div>
     </li>

     <li>
       <div>
         <strong>HIS SPEECH DURING RIVONIA TRIAL IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREAT SPEECHES OF THE 20TH CENTURY</strong>
         Mandela came to the conclusion that violent action would be necessary to end apartheid. In 1961, he co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe<i> (“Spear of the Nation”, MK),</i> 
         the armed wing of the ANC. MK planned to carry out acts of sabotage that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties. It was classified as a terrorist organization by the SA government. 
         The police captured Mandela on 5th August 1962. The following year, he and his comrades were charged with sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government in what is known as the Rivonia Trial. During the trial, Mandela gave his famous three-hour long “I Am Prepared to Die” speech, 
         considered one of the great speeches of the 20th century and a key moment in the anti-apartheid struggle.
      </div>

    <li>
      <div>
        <strong>NELSON MANDELA PLAYED THE LEADING ROLE IN ENDING APARTHEID</strong> 
        Mandela spent 27 years of his life in prison from 1964 till 1990. He had to face numerous atrocities including solitary confinement. He continued to be influential even in prison and there were numerous calls for his release. 
       In February 1985, South African president P. W. Botha offered to free Mandela but Mandela refused saying that the government must first dismantle apartheid. F. W. de Klerk was sworn in as President of South Africa in August 1989. Amid growing domestic and international pressure,
       President de Klerk released Nelson Mandela on February 11, 1990. After his release, Mandela embarked on an international tour to encourage foreign countries to support sanctions against the SA apartheid government.

      <div>
        <strong>NELSON MANDELA WAS THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA</strong> 
        General elections were held in South Africa on 27th April 1994. This was the first general elections in the country in which citizens of all races were allowed to vote. This multiracial election was therefore also the first in SA with universal adult suffrage. 
        27th April is now celebrated as the national day of South Africa and is a public holiday. Led by Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) won a sweeping victory in the 1994 election taking 62 percent of the vote. Nelson Mandela thus became the first black head of state in South Africa and the first to be elected in a fully 
        representative democratic election. He served as President of South Africa from 10th May 1994 to 14 June 1999.
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div>
        <strong>HE FOCUSED ON NATIONAL RECONCILIATION DURING HIS PRESIDENCY</strong> 
        The top priority of Nelson Mandela during his presidency was national reconciliation. He worked to reassure South Africa’s white population that they were represented in the government and would not be discriminated against. Despite having overwhelming majority, 
        Mandela appointed de Klerk as Deputy President and other National Party officials as ministers in various departments. He emphasized on personal forgiveness and reconciliation. In one of the most famous events, Mandela brought the nation together by encouraging the blacks to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, during the 1995 Rugby World Cup, 
        which was held in SA. South Africa went on to win the event and Mandela presented the cup to the SA captain.
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div>
        <strong>HE SERVED AS THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT FROM 1998 TO 1999</strong> 
        When Nelson Mandela took over as president, out of a population of 40 million, 23 million lacked electricity; 12 million lacked clean water supplies; and 2 million children were not in school. By the end of his term as president in 1999, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid; water access
        was extended to 3 million people; 1.5 million children were brought into the education system; and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people. Also, in 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women. Internationally, Nelson Mandela served from 1998 to 1999 as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, 
        a group of states that are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. 
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div>
        <strong>HE FOUNDED A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE EQUALITY AND FIGHT PROBLEMS LIKE AIDS</strong> 
        In 1995, Mandela found the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund, a charitable organization which aims to help individuals from birth to age 22, particularly orphans of the AIDS crisis. In 1999, he found the Nelson Mandela Foundation 
        to promote his vision of freedom and equality for all. Post presidency, Mandela raised money to build schools and clinics in South Africa’s rural areas; advocated for peace and equality; and remained committed in his fight against AIDS, a disease that killed one of his sons. In 2007, Mandela brought together a number of elder statesmen, peace activists and human rights advocates to form an organization called The Elders, 
        whose goal is to work on solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems such as climate change, HIV/AIDS and poverty; and to help resolve conflicts which are difficult to handle. 
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div>
        <strong>NELSON MANDELA WAS AWARDED THE 1993 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE</strong> 
        Mandela received more than 260 honors in his lifetime including <i> the Soviet Union’s Lenin Peace Prize (1990);</i>  António Agostinho Neto Order (1990), the highest honor of the People’s Republic of Angola; Bharat Ratna (1990), 
        India’s highest civilian award; National Order of Mali (Grande Croix, 1996), Mali’s highest decoration; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2002), the United States’ highest civilian award. In 1993, Nelson Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize <i> “for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa”.</i>
